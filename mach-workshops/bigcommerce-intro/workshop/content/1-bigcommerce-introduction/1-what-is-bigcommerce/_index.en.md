BigCommerce is an E-Commerce platform which allows business to build a store and sell their products or services digitally. That is actually so easy to start with so that they can create and run their online stores remotely as long as they have connections to a web browser and the Internet.

As any other platform, BigCommerce has their limitations. I will list a couple of them below. The whole list you may find at https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Platform-Limits?language=en_US
