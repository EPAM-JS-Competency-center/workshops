There are 2 types of email template, e.g. "Transactional Emails" and "Abadoned Cart Emails"

Let's review how to work with them.

1. Open Control Panel > Marketing > Transactional Emails.

2. Click on "Edit Template" option for a template.

4. You may update the template itself at "Code" section.

5. You may preview and even send test email at "Preview" section.

### Actually, it's not quite easy to update email templates in Control Panel, so you may create a script which could update templates via API.
